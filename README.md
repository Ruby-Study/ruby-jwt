# JWT
A Ruby implementation of [JSON Web Token draft 06](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token-06.html).

## Installing

    sudo gem install jwt

## Usage

    payload = {"some" => "payload"}
    JWT.encode(payload, "secret")

Note the resulting JWT will not be encrypted, but verifiable with a secret key.

    JWT.decode('someJWTstring', 'secret')

If the secret is wrong, it will raise a `JWT::DecodeError` telling you as such. You can still get at the payload by setting the verify argument to false.

    JWT.decode('someJWTstring', nil, false)

`encode` also allows for different signing algorithms as well as customer headers.

    JWT.encode(payload, secret, "RS256", {"some" => "header"})

## Algorithms

The JWT spec supports several algorithms for cryptographic signing. This library currently supports:

**HMAC**

* HS256	- HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm (default)
* HS384	- HMAC using SHA-384 hash algorithm
* HS512 - HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm

**RSA**

* RS256 - RSA using SHA-256 hash algorithm
* RS384 - RSA using SHA-384 hash algorithm
* RS512 - RSA using SHA-512 hash algorithm

Change the algorithm with by setting it in encode:

    JWT.encode({'some' => 'payload'}, 'secret', 'HS512')

**Plaintext**

We also support unsigned plaintext JWTs as introduced by draft 03 by explicitly specifying `nil` as the key and algorithm:

    jwt = JWT.encode({'some' => 'payload'}, nil, nil)
    JWT.decode(jwt, nil, nil)

## Support for reserved claim names
JSON Web Token defines some reserved claim names and defines how they should be
used. JWT supports these reserved claim names:

 - 'exp' (Expiration Time) Claim
 - 'nbf' (Not Before Time) Claim
 - 'iss' (Issuer) Claim
 - 'aud' (Audience) Claim
 - 'jti' (JWT ID) Claim
 - 'iat' (Issued At) Claim
 - 'sub' (Subject) Claim

### Expiration Time Claim

From [draft 01 of the JWT spec](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token-01.html#ReservedClaimName):

> The exp (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after
> which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the exp
> claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration
> date/time listed in the exp claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small
> leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its
> value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value. Use of this claim is
> OPTIONAL.

You pass the expiration time as a UTC UNIX timestamp (an int). For example:

    JWT.encode({'exp': 1371720939}, 'secret')

    JWT.encode({'exp': Time.now.to_i()}, 'secret')

Expiration time is automatically verified in `JWT.decode()` and raises
`JWT::ExpiredSignature` if the expiration time is in the past:

    begin
        JWT.decode('JWT_STRING', 'secret')
    rescue JWT::ExpiredSignature
        # Signature has expired
	end

Expiration time will be compared to the current UTC time (as given by
`Time.now.to_i`), so be sure to use a UTC timestamp or datetime in encoding.

You can turn off expiration time verification with the `verify_expiration` option.

JWT also supports the leeway part of the expiration time definition, which
means you can validate a expiration time which is in the past but not very far.
For example, if you have a JWT payload with a expiration time set to 30 seconds
after creation but you know that sometimes you will process it after 30 seconds,
you can set a leeway of 10 seconds in order to have some margin:

    jwt_payload = JWT.encode({'exp': Time.now.to_i + 30}, 'secret')
    sleep(32)
    # jwt_payload is now expired
    # But with some leeway, it will still validate
    JWT.decode(jwt_payload, 'secret', true, {:leeway => 10})

### Not Before Time Claim

From [draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#nbfDef):

> The nbf (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT
> be accepted for processing. The processing of the nbf claim requires that the
> current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed
> in the nbf claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no
> more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number
> containing a NumericDate value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

You pass the not before time as a UTC UNIX timestamp (an int). For example:

    JWT.encode({'nbf': 1371720939}, 'secret')

    JWT.encode({'nbf': Time.now.to_i()}, 'secret')

Not before time is automatically verified in `JWT.decode()` and raises
`JWT::ImmatureSignature` if the not before time is in the future:

    begin
        JWT.decode('JWT_STRING', 'secret')
    rescue JWT::ImmatureSignature
        # Signature is immature
	end

Not before time will be compared to the current UTC time (as given by
`Time.now.to_i`), so be sure to use a UTC timestamp or datetime in encoding.

You can turn off not before time verification with the `verify_not_before` option.

In a similar way to the expiration time claim, the not before time claim supports
the leeway option.

    jwt_payload = JWT.encode({'nbf': Time.now.to_i + 30}, 'secret')
    sleep(25)
    # jwt_payload is now immature
    # But with some leeway, it will still validate
    JWT.decode(jwt_payload, 'secret', true, {:leeway => 10})

# Development and Tests

We depend on [Echoe](http://rubygems.org/gems/echoe) for defining gemspec and performing releases to rubygems.org, which can be done with

    rake release

The tests are written with rspec. Given you have rake and rspec, you can run tests with

    rake test

**If you want a release cut with your PR, please include a version bump according to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)**
